# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed,
# the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will
# automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

# Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of
# money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

# Example 1:

# Input: [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
#              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
# Example 2:

# Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
# Output: 12
# Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
#              Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.


class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

      # Iterative
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0

        memo = [0, nums[0]]
        i = 1
        while i < len(nums):
            memo.append(max(memo[i], memo[i-1] + nums[i]))
            i += 1
        return memo[-1]


# Recursive Solution: TLE
        # def rob_max(arr, start):
        #     try:
        #         return arr[start] + max(rob_max(arr, start+2), rob_max(arr, start+3))
        #     except:
        #         return 0

        # if nums is None:
        #     return 0

        # return max(get_max(nums, 0), get_max(nums, 1))

        # Another recursive solution
        # Rob either current house i and best houses i-2 behind OR do not rob current house i but rob best houses from i-1 and behind
        # def rob_max_2(nums, idx):
        #     if idx < 0:
        #         return 0
        #     return max(rob_max_2(nums, idx-2) + nums[idx], rob_max_2(nums, idx-1))
